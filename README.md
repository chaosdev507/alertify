# Alertify

This Flutter project showcases the implementation of Clean Architecture principles using Riverpod for state management. Clean Architecture promotes a separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, testable, and maintainable. Riverpod, a provider package in Flutter, offers a pragmatic solution for managing application state while adhering to the principles of dependency injection.

## Features

- Modular Structure: The project is organized into layers, including domain, data, and presentation layers, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
- Dependency Injection: Utilizing Riverpod for dependency injection ensures loose coupling between different components of the application, making it easier to manage dependencies and facilitate testing.
- Fully Tested Codebase: The code in this project has been extensively tested, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the system.
- Scalability: The architecture design facilitates scalability, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without causing cascading changes across the codebase.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
